# cfdg

**cfdg** is collection of [Context Free designs](https://www.contextfreeart.org) written in the _context free grammar_ and originally published on _contextfreeart.org_, and my former personal site, in 2007.

Some of these designs were later published in the book; [*Community of Variation*](https://www.contextfreeart.org/book.html) — a collection of works by 29 members of the Context Free Art community between 2005-2007.
